This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

**Project: TalentBook - An Airbnb-style Talent Booking Platform**

TalentBook is a full-stack web application developed to modernize and simplify the talent booking industry. It serves as a two-sided marketplace connecting talent (models, actors, etc.) with clients (businesses, agencies).

**Core Functionality:**

*   **For Clients/Agencies:**
    *   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Discover talent based on specific criteria such as role, physical attributes (height, etc.), location, and availability.
    *   **Detailed Portfolios:** View comprehensive talent profiles featuring high-quality photo galleries, video showreels, and work experience.
    *   **Seamless Booking System:** Send booking requests, manage confirmed jobs, and communicate directly with talent.
    *   **Review & Rating System:** Build a trusted community by leaving reviews for talent after a project is completed.

*   **For Talent:**
    *   **Dynamic Portfolio Creation:** Easily create and manage a professional portfolio by uploading images and videos.
    *   **Profile Management:** Update personal information, physical stats, skills, and availability calendar.
    *   **Booking Management:** Receive, accept, or decline booking requests directly through a personal dashboard.
    *   **Real-time Chat:** Communicate with clients securely once a booking is confirmed to discuss project details.

**Technology Stack:** Built with Next.js and powered by Supabase for database management, authentication, and real-time features.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
